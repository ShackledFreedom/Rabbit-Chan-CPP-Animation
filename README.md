After reading the egotistical ramblings of an AI shArtist, I took up the challenge given: draw an OC with a mouse and keyboard.

It was no struggle. In fact, it was fun MAKING it myself instead of taking credit for AI generated content.

Your move, shartists.

# How to use

The code is on here just to hold the code. But, if you really want to run it as intended, then all you need to do is compile the cpp file with

```g++ main.cpp -o main```

and run it with

```./main```



Note that it expects an audio file named 'fnaf.opus' in the same directory as the compiled binary.
